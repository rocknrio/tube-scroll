# tube-scroll
Mod for YouTube to keep video on top while scrolling through comments. This is my first attempt at updating/altering a script. The purpose is for me to learn and to make the script suit my preferences, as well as to update the functionality. I am trying to accomodate the YouTube website changes that have occurred since the original author (tforbus) last updated it in 2014.
